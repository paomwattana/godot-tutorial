# Godot Tutorial Playground
## Description
From Heartbeast's godot action RPG tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9FzW-m48fn2SlrW0KoLT4n5egNdX-W9a).

This just serves as a playground for me to mess things up in godot.

## Things I Successfully Added Myself
- Red (fast) bat and large (sturdy) bat enemies
- Fancy effects when hitting bushes
- Display messages when the player gets hit by bat (to be polished)
- Start Menu

## Installation
1. Clone this repo or download zip, etc.
2. Download Godot [here](https://godotengine.org/).
3. Run godot and open the downloaded folder as project.
4. Press "Play" button at the top right.
